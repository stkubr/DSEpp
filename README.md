## DSEpp
The library provides basic objects and core numerical routines, needed for a scientific calculations within the framework of
Dyson-Schwinger equations([DSE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger%E2%80%93Dyson_equation))
and Bette-Salpeter equations([BSE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethe%E2%80%93Salpeter_equation)). 
## Link to scientific study
The related research carried out by developing and using this library is reported in https://github.com/stkubr/Thesis/blob/master/Thesis_Kubrak.pdf <br />
Note however this is only partial release and most of features mentioned in the thesis are not present in library.
## Compile and Run example
You would need installed Cmake with version minimum 2.8.12 <br />
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release CMakeLists.txt <br />
